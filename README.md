# Minimalistic 3D Renderer

## Overview

A minimalistic 3D renderer implemented with SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer). This project demonstrates basic 3D rendering techniques using SDL for window management and input handling. The goal is to provide a simple yet effective way to understand the fundamentals of 3D rendering.

## Features

- Basic 3D rendering with SDL
- Window management using SDL
- Input handling for navigation and interaction
- Support for rendering simple geometric shapes

## Requirements

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **C++ Compiler** (g++, clang, etc.)
- **CMake** (version 3.10 or higher)
- **SDL2** (Simple DirectMedia Layer)

### Installing SDL2 on Ubuntu

You can install SDL2 using the following command:
